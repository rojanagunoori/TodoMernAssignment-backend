## 📌 Project Overview

TaskMaster is a full-stack task management web application designed to help users efficiently organize and track their daily activities. It provides a seamless experience where users can securely authenticate, manage personal tasks, and maintain their profile information.

The application follows a **client-server architecture**, with a React-based frontend communicating with a RESTful API built using Node.js and Express. SQLite is used as a lightweight database for storing user and task data.

This project demonstrates core full-stack development concepts such as:

- Authentication and authorization using JWT
- CRUD operations with persistent storage
- API integration between frontend and backend
- State management and protected routing in React
- Deployment of a full-stack application

It is designed to be scalable and can be extended with advanced features like filtering, reminders, and cloud database integration.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication System**
  Secure signup and login functionality using hashed passwords and JWT tokens.

- 🔑 **JWT-Based Authorization**
  Protected API endpoints ensure that only authenticated users can access their data.

- 👤 **Profile Management**
  Users can view, update, and delete their account information.

- ✅ **Complete Task Management (CRUD)**
  Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks with real-time updates in the UI.

- 📱 **Responsive User Interface**
  Mobile-friendly design with a collapsible navigation menu for smaller screens.

- 🔔 **Real-Time Feedback with Toast Notifications**
  Instant success and error messages improve user experience.

- 🧭 **Protected Routes in Frontend**
  Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive pages like profile and tasks.

- ⚡ **Fast and Lightweight Backend**
  Uses SQLite for quick setup and efficient data handling.

## 🧩 Key Components

### Frontend

- **Auth.js**
  Handles both login and signup functionality with dynamic form switching. Integrates with backend APIs and manages authentication state.

- **Tasks.js**
  Core component for task management. Supports creating, updating, deleting, and displaying tasks with API integration and state updates.

- **Profile.js**
  Displays user information and allows editing or deleting the account. Communicates securely with protected backend endpoints.

- **Navbar.js**
  Provides navigation across the application. Includes responsive design with a mobile toggle menu and conditional rendering based on authentication status.

---

### Backend

- **server.js**
  Main server file containing API routes, middleware (JWT authentication), and request handling logic. Acts as the backbone of the application.

- **db.js**
  Initializes and manages the SQLite database. Defines schema for users and tasks, ensuring relational integrity.

---

## 🔒 Security

- Password hashing using **bcrypt**
- Token-based authentication using **JWT**
- Protected routes via middleware
- Authorization headers required for secured endpoints

---

## ⚔️ Challenges Faced During Development

- 🔐 **JWT Authentication Handling**
  Implementing secure token-based authentication and ensuring tokens are correctly verified for protected routes required careful middleware design.

- 🔄 **Protected Routing in React**
  Managing user sessions and redirecting users based on authentication state was challenging, especially with page refresh scenarios.

- 🌐 **CORS Issues During Deployment**
  Configuring CORS correctly between Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend) required debugging origin policies and headers.

- 🔗 **Frontend-Backend Synchronization**
  Ensuring consistent API communication and handling different environments (local vs production) required proper configuration management.

- 🐞 **Debugging Asynchronous API Calls**
  Handling errors in async operations and preventing UI crashes required robust error handling strategies.

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements

- 🗂️ **Task Categories & Filtering**
  Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., Work, Personal) and filter them for better organization.

- 📄 **Pagination & Performance Optimization**
  Improve performance for large datasets by implementing pagination or lazy loading.

- ⏰ **Due Dates & Reminders**
  Add deadlines and notification systems to enhance productivity.

- 🎨 **Enhanced UI/UX**
  Introduce animations, better design systems, and improved accessibility.

- ☁️ **Database Upgrade (SQLite → MongoDB)**
  Transition to a scalable cloud database for production-level applications.

- 🧪 **Testing Implementation**
  Add unit tests and integration tests to improve reliability and maintainability.

- 🔐 **Advanced Security Enhancements**
  Implement features like refresh tokens, rate limiting, and input validation.
